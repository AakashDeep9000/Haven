						<h2>Greetings!</h2>
						<p>Welcome to <strong>The Haven!</strong> You are about to experience the best of both mother nature and all her beautiful children. Brace yourselves for an experience like never before as you delve into the bosom of the natural world. "Where?" you might ask...<em>All is lost and everything is found at Haven...</em></p>
						<p>Our naturalists and staff will only be pleased to give you pointers and help you discover the subtle facets of nature. Meal times here come with a huge serving of scenery. From the Gol Ghar, where meals are served, if you look carefully enough, you’re sure to spot a good many birds. Evenings with the barbecue by the riverside and the bonfire are bonding sessions, where our guests get to know each other. But if it’s quiet you desire, you can choose to converse with the stars, reclined on a lawn chair or stretched out on a hammock until your grilled fish or chicken or vegetables arrive. Each tent has a hammock outside. </p>
