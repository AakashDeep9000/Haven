This is my website that speaks about a hypothetical nature resort named "The Haven". It is designed to attract customers with attractive images and alluring text. The aim of the resort is to provide people with the soothing touch of mother nature that they long for and cannot obtain in an environment filled with the noise and pollution of the city.
The page includes a fixed header, two gridded sections with 3 and 2 columns respectively, a hero section and a footer providing details regarding the contacts.
